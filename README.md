# Forest_Cover_Classification APP

## 💡 Problem Statement:

To create an AI solution for forest maintenance using machine learning and to implement following use cases. 
To predict the cover type of the forest based on provided data. 

## 📝 Proposed Solution:

The solution proposed here is a machine learning based system which can be implemented to perform above mentioned use cases. In the above mentioned use case this system will ask the user to provide data for prediction and data can be in batch files or single values whichever is preferable by the user. After taking data, The system will process the data and provide the predictions in the form of a csv file. 

## ⏳ Data Description

Dataset available on UCI: [Forest Cover Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/c/forest-cover-type-prediction/data)

This dataset contains `5 lack plus` records with `52` features.

## 🛠 Tools used

Python programming language and frameworks such as NumPy, Pandas and Scikit-learn are used to build the whole model.

- PyCharm is used as an IDE.
- For visualization of the plots, Matplotlib and Seaborn are used.
- Heroku Cloud Platform is used for deployment of the model.
- Front end development is done using HTML/CSS
- Flask framework is used for backend development
- GitHub is used as a version control system.
- CI/CD is done using GitHub Actions

## 👨🏻‍💻 Web App
